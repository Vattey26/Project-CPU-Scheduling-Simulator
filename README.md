# CPU Scheduling Simulator 

## Overview
This is a **CPU Scheduling Simulator** built with Python and Tkinter.  
It allows users to input processes manually or load them from CSV/JSON files, simulate CPU scheduling, and visualize the results.

Currently implemented:
- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
- **SRT (Shortest Remaining Time)**
- **RR (Round Robin)**
- **MLFQ (Multilevel Feedback Queue)**

---

## Features
- Add processes manually (PID, Arrival, Burst).
- Load processes from CSV or JSON files.
- View live process list.
- Select scheduling algorithm (currently only FCFS works).
- Specify quantum for RR/MLFQ (future feature).
- Run simulation and see results in a table:
  - **Waiting Time (WT)**
  - **Turnaround Time (TAT)**
  - **Response Time (RT)**
- Gantt chart visualization with start/end times.
- Save results to CSV or JSON.

---

## Getting Started (Git)

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Installation
If you are using Git to set up:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vattey26/CPU-Scheduling-Simulator.git
cd cpu-scheduling-simulator
```
If you are dowloading the file:
1. Clone or download the project ZIP.
2. Extract the ZIP to a folder.
3. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
