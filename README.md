# CPU Scheduling Simulator 

## Overview
This is a **CPU Scheduling Simulator** built with Python and Tkinter.  
It allows users to input processes manually or load them from CSV/JSON files, simulate CPU scheduling, and visualize the results.

---

## Features
- **Supported Algorithms**
  - FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - SRT (Shortest Remaining Time)
  - RR (Round Robin)
  - MLFQ (Multi-Level Feedback Queue)
- **Process Management**
  - Add processes manually
  - Load processes from CSV or JSON files
- **Simulation**
  - Compute metrics: Waiting Time (WT), Turnaround Time (TAT), Response Time (RT)
  - Visualize process execution using a Gantt chart
- **Export Results**
  - Save simulation results to CSV or JSON

## Getting Started (Git)

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Installation
If you are using Git to set up:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
